# HomeAutomation_w-w-o-internet

Here,  Blynk IoT platform is used for the internet controlled part and the manual switches and capacitive regulator for the non internet part.
This project was mainly focused on the automated process but in case of internet unavailability or unstable connection, manual switches are prvided.
This project also focuses on automatic on/off of a fan without the need to regulate everytime.
